# 🪙 Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the future prices of gold using historical data and machine learning models. It demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression algorithms in Python.

# 🔍 Overview
Gold is a valuable commodity and its price is influenced by several global factors. In this project, we use historical gold price data to train machine learning models that can predict future prices.
